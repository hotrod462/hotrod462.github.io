## Why make a blog in the first place?
The whole idea of having a blog came to me when I realized that I would be joining no clubs in my time here in IITM. Thus, I would have absolutely nothing to show fot the empty year I plan to have. As I do not want to seem like an absolute loafer, a blog to document my adventures navigating the delightfully peculiar world of programming and computer science seemed to be a good idea.

## How did it come about?
I'm taking a course on machine learning off of youtube, but again, I was going to have no formal record of what I had learnt, so making the blog had to become a priority.

## Stage 1
I decided to use making the blog to dip my toes into the world of full stack development, so I picked up a freeCodeCamp tutorial again off of youtube and started learning html. This was a bit of a waste, as I knew quite a lot of html from school but it was fun at the very least. I made a favicon in paint for the website which had everyone around me in the lab question my sanity :)
