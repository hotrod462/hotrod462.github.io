## Why make a blog in the first place?
The whole idea of having a blog came to me when I realized that I would be joining no clubs in my time here in IITM. Thus, I would have absolutely nothing to show fot the empty year I plan to have. As I do not want to seem like an absolute loafer, a blog to document my adventures navigating the delightfully peculiar world of programming and computer science seemed to be a good idea.

##How did it come about?
I had been taking a course on machine learning off of youtube, but again, I was going to have no formal record of what I had learnt, so making the blog had to become a priority.
